## Deep convolutional models

###### 1. R was developed by statisticians working at
- The University of Auckland

###### 2. The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.
- The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.
- The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.

###### 3. In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)
- list
- table
- data frame
- array
- matrix

###### 4. If I execute the expression `x <- 4L` in R, what is the class of the object `x` as determined by the `class()` function?
- integer

###### 5. What is the class of the object defined by the expression `x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)`?
- character

###### 6. If I have two vectors `x <- c(1,3, 5)` and `y <- c(3, 2, 10)`, what is produced by the expression `cbind(x, y)`?
- a matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows

###### 7. A key property of vectors in R is that
- elements of a vector all must be of the same class

###### 8. Suppose I have a list defined as `x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE)`. What does `x[[1]]` give me? Select all that apply.
- a list containing the number 2
- a numeric vector containing the element 2

###### 9. Suppose I have a vector `x <- 1:4` and `y <- 2:3`. What is produced by the expression `x + y`?
- an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7

###### 10. Suppose I have a vector `x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10)` and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.
- `x[x > 10] <- 4`
